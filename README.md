# Election_Analysis

## Project Overview

A Colorado Board of Election employee (Tom) and his boss (Seth) brought us in to help audit a recent election that took place. They've asked us to find out the total number of votes, the number of votes each candidate received, the percentage of the votes each candidate received and the overall winner of the election.

## Resources

- Data pulled from: election_results.csv
- Software used: Python v3.7.6, Visual Studio Code v1.68.1

## Summary

Upon completion of the audit it was found that there were 369,711 total votes dispersed among three candidates: 

Charles Casper Stockham, Diana DeGette and Raymon Anthony Doane.

Raymon received 3.1% of the vote with 11,606 votes.

Charles received 23% of the vote with 85, 213 votes.

Diana received 73.8% of the vote with 272, 892 votes.

This clearly made Diana the winner of the election with nearly 3/4 of the total number of votes. Congratulations to Diana on her victory.

# Week 3 Challenge

## Challenge Overview
For this week's challenge we were asked to continue our analysis of the election mentioned above but to focus on the counties involved and their total votes/percentages. We were then asked to join that data with the data that we found above.

## Challenge Results
The results of our new analysis were as follows:

County Votes:

Jefferson: 10.5% (38,855)
Denver: 82.8% (306,055)
Arapahoe: 6.7% (24,801)

This clearly shows that Denver had the biggest turnout and as a result they were the main influence for the election. Our final analysis looked like this:
